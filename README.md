# A-Comprehensive-Tweet-Store-Search-and-Cache-System
I spearheaded the Data Management Final Project, focusing on the intricate interplay of key components in modern data management systems. Utilizing a two-tier strategy, I employed MongoDB, MySQL, and FRISK for data storage and user interface, coupled with Python programming for cache, search engine, and data system operations. Two JSON datasets, Corona 2 and Corona 3, mimicking Twitter tweet volumes, were strategically stored in relational and non-relational databases, optimizing efficiency. MySQL showcased its robustness and data integrity in handling user information, while MongoDB's flexibility accommodated tweets and retweets seamlessly. The project's success is evident in the showcased logic, code snippets, and output, highlighting my adeptness in navigating and comprehending complex data management scenarios.

I led the design of a robust Search Application that seamlessly integrates relational and non-relational databases using Flask. The application, enables users to search on strings, hashtags, and users. Additional features, such as date range and relevance-based searches for hashtags, were implemented to enhance user experience. The search engine's performance was optimized through indexing hashtag records in MongoDB. Caching was implemented using the Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy, enhancing search speed and resource utilization. The application successfully transformed complex data management scenarios into an efficient database system, showcasing the team's expertise in handling unstructured records effectively. Future considerations include refining the cache strategy, better integration of MongoDB and MySQL, exploring Redis for caching, and exploring horizontal scaling with MongoDB's map-reduce feature.
